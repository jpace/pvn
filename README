pvn adds functionality stolen and inspired by Perforce and Git, as well as just
things I thought about.

What it isn't: a replace for svn (the command). The intent here is not to do
everything svn does, but better. Maybe some day.

The first thing that will probably jump out at you, and what I think is probably
most likely to be absorbed into svn itself, is that pvn handles "relative
revisions". That is, "+n" is the nth revision for the given path, and "-n" is
the nth from the last revision, where -1 means the last revision.

Thus for the following changes:

r1947 | easter.bunny | 2011-11-14 07:24:45 -0500 (Mon, 14 Nov 2011) | 1 line
r1714 | santa.claus | 2011-09-22 16:38:30 -0400 (Thu, 22 Sep 2011) | 1 line
r1192 | santa.claus | 2011-09-05 03:51:04 -0400 (Mon, 05 Sep 2011) | 1 line
r1145 | tooth.fairy | 2011-08-02 04:57:23 -0400 (Tue, 02 Aug 2011) | 1 line
r1143 | santa.claus | 2011-07-29 07:51:49 -0400 (Fri, 29 Jul 2011) | 1 line
r1049 | santa.claus | 2011-06-22 07:17:43 -0400 (Wed, 22 Jun 2011) | 1 line

Relative revision +0 is r1049, -1 is r1947, +1 is r1143, and so on.

Thus diff'ing can be done with a shorter command line:

    svn diff -r1143:1714

    pvn diff +1 -2

Yes, pvn is smart enough not to need the -r tag, at least with relative revisions.

That is what I consider the best feature so far, and it's not even implemented
right now. (It was, and right now the entire app is being rewritten, so the
future, present, and past tenses are all applicable.)
